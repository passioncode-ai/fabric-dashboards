# Handoff — Fabric Dashboards

Updated 2026-09-29.

## Objective

One protocol (`fabric-service/0.1`), one Fabric skill set, one desktop app (Fabric
Dashboards) and one self-updating PassionCode.ai skill launcher — see the
[design](design/2026-09-28-fabric-dashboards-design.md) and the
[brief](evidence/briefs/2026-09-28-brief.md) (REQ-01…24, decisions, carry-over ledger).
Cross-repository index: `passioncode-ai/org-index` → `docs/runs/2026-09-28-fabric-dashboards/`.

## State

| Piece | Where | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol `fabric-service/0.1` | `fabric-agent-contract` PR #6 | merged (`a5a2709`) | `pnpm run check` exit 0 on the merged main |
| Skill `building-fabric-services` | `fabric-agent-adapter` PR #2 (`v0.4.0`), PR #4 (`v0.4.2`, `e09551f`) | merged, tagged; the kit's `LoopbackHTTPServer` binds without a resolver (0.4.2); **on npm** as `@passioncode-ai/fabric-agent-adapter@0.4.2` | `npm test`, both `claude plugin validate --strict` |
| Cross-repository ADR | `fabric` ADR-0083 (PR #2) | merged | `scripts/check-docs.sh`, `check-registers.mjs` |
| Product mark | `passioncode-ai.github.io` PR #6 | merged | site `npm run check` |
| **Fabric Dashboards 0.1.0** | this repository, tag `v0.1.0` | **released** — [GitHub release](https://github.com/passioncode-ai/fabric-dashboards/releases/tag/v0.1.0), installed in `/Applications` on the operator's Mac, login item registered | receipt: Developer ID, notarization `accepted and stapled`, Gatekeeper `accepted`; `update-feed.json` and the zip download anonymously (HTTP 200) |
| Launcher `@passioncode-ai/passioncode` 0.1.4 | `passioncode` tag `v0.1.4` (`df38fd3`) | **on npm**; this Mac updated from npm; the self-update sees 0.1.4 by `ssheleg`, a trusted publisher | `npx @passioncode-ai/passioncode@latest status`: 3 plugins, hubs 3/3, no shadows |
| Project Observatory server | `project-observatory-dashboard` PR #75 → 0.8.0 (`d454fb4`, tag `v0.8.0`) | merged through all three required checks, released, installed on the operator's Mac with its descriptor | live `check_service.py`: 20 rules, 0 FAIL, 1 NOT_RUN (no login declared) |
| The operator's own services | their private repositories | merged and reinstalled locally only; not published, not named here | each probed live; the only FAIL left is one data directory the operator chose to keep inside its checkout |

This repository was recreated from a clean tree on 2026-09-29 so that nothing about the
operator's personal agents is public; the development history is kept privately in
`passioncode-ai/fabric-dashboards-archive`.

## Open

- UX scenarios are `draft` until the operator approves them from the running app.
- **Releases from GitHub are wired but cannot run yet.** Both packages name their `release.yml`
  as npm trusted publisher (OIDC, `createPackage` + stage), and both repositories set
  `RELEASE_ENABLED` / `PUBLISH_NPMJS`. Hosted Actions in these private repositories do not
  start: GitHub answers "recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to
  be increased" (runs on `v0.4.0`–`v0.4.2`). The operator decides: raise the limit, or make both
  repositories public after a history audit (the npm tarballs are public already).
- `http.server` asks the resolver for its FQDN between `bind()` and `listen()`; on the macOS
  runner the port stayed bound but silent. Fixed in the adapter kit (`LoopbackHTTPServer`,
  0.4.2) and in every server that used the stdlib class.
- An e2e run wrote into the operator's `~/Library/Logs/Fabric Dashboards/main.log`:
  `FABRIC_DASHBOARDS_USER_DATA` now moves `logs` too (`10948f5`, e2e asserts it).

## Known residue

- Two `enabled` launchd overrides from the first test runs remain in the operator's
  launchd database for labels `ai.passioncode.fabric-dashboards.test.<pid>.<port>`. They do
  nothing; launchctl cannot delete an override. Later runs use one fixed label.

## Checks run

`npm run check` (exit 0, 23 tests incl. a real launchd job), `npm run test:e2e` (pass),
`npm run dist -- --notary-profile fabric-notary` from `v0.1.0` (receipt above), and a real
Electron capture of an embedded dashboard at the bounds of the dashboard area.
